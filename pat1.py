Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way to write computer programs by thinking about real things, like cars.

Class: The general plan for a car. It says every car should have things like a brand, color, and speed.
Object: A real car you see on the road, like a red Maruti or a blue Ford. Each one is made from the plan (class) but has its own details.
Property: The details about a car, such as its brand, color, and how fast it can go.
Method: The actions a car can do, like start, stop, accelerate, or honk.
In OOP, you make a plan for cars (the class), and then you can create as many real cars (objects) as you want, each with their own details and abilities!
